# Web App Pentest Methodology
## Introduction

This methodology covers the basics of conducting a web application pentest. It is aimed at beginners and those who want a refresher on the basics of conducting such an assessment.

It assumes a scoping exercise has been conducted prior to the engagement beginning proper. The methodology covers most common web application vulnerabilities and provides guidance for approaching the relevant part of the test. Optional comments include further information on exploits and common *incorrect* approaches to securing applications from select vulnerabilities.

This methodology works for any type of pentest; regardless of whether you have access to the source code for the application. The methodology aims to focus thinking on the business-side of cyber security by ensuring word conducted is contextualised for the relevant client.

Large parts of the methodology are derived from the [OWASP Web Security Testing Guide](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/stable/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/), supplemented with my own knowledge and experience.
